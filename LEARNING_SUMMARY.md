Scale AI in your organisation<br />
•	Learned how to apply best practises for innovation in organisations, evaluate and prioritise AI investments, and also how to establish AI-related roles and responsibilities.<br />
•	Learned what MLOps is. Am able to now identify the different steps of the machine learning lifecycle, describe how to create and manage machine learning models using MLOps processes, and also how to articulate processes to monitor models and respond to incidents

Use visual tools to create machine learning models with Azure Machine Learning<br /> 
•	Explored machine learning and learned how to use Azure Machine Learning to train and deploy and predictive model<br />
•	Use Azure Machine Learning designer to train and publish a regression model, classification model, clustering model 

Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks<br />
•	Learned how to analyse data with Azure Notebooks<br />
•	Understood how to use multiple libraries such as Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib<br />
•	Learned how to use Keras with Azure Notebooks 

Build real world applications with Python<br />
•	Learned about the python basics<br />
•	Learned about object-oriented programming, and how to model my problems using OOP methodology, and how to implement code to support my model using OP constructs<br />
•	Understood the core concepts of building websites in Python using the Flask framework

**Overall Learning Journey:**<br />
Overall, through this project has introduced to the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning and has allowed me to discover the countless possibilities that these powerful tools have to offer. Additionally, the project has allowed me to understand Microsoft Azure more further in depth.
