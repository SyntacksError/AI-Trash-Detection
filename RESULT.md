My model ended up performing extremely poorly, not being able to detect most forms of rubbish, especially when there is a change of lighting or angle. This was honestly mostly expected. Due to the copious amount of rubbish, with varying shapes, sizes, and colours. In order for a somewhat decent model, I would need monumental amount of data, which just wasnâ€™t possible with Azure Custom Vision AI service, as having to manually tag each picture would take far too long.

In order to improve, I could instead use a dataset from the internet and look into using a different sort of approach so that I can work with a larger dataset.
